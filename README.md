## What is it
My current blog is served up on a shared host using WordPress as a CMS.
After being targeted by iranians trying to grow their botnet, I'm not longer satisfied with WordPress.
This repo is an exploration of reimplementing my blog using a variety of popular frameworks in use today.

### Frameworks + techniques to try:
* Static content, manually managed via html, css, and js via html5 bp and twitter bootstrap
* Static site generators like jekyll or pelican.
* Client-side js frameworks like Angular.js paired with server-side web services.

Currently implementing manually managed static site with bootstrap and html 5 boilerplate.
